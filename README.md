# BB84_simulation

A project to perform Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using the BB84 protocol.

## Overview

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technique that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to enable two parties to generate a shared, secret cryptographic key. This project simulates the BB84 protocol to demonstrate how secure keys can be distributed with quantum properties.


### Reference

The simulation and methodology follow principles outlined in *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang. 

## Implementation Details

- **Simulation Steps**:
  - Generation of random bit sequences.
  - Application of quantum state preparation and measurement functions.
  - Basis comparison and error-checking algorithms.
